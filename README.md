# The Kings List

Is an idea for a new way of personal bucket list.

What it is supposed to do:
  - Easily create items and strike them through when fulfilled
  - Let people add stuff to your list by a form
  - Accept those items
  - Live an awesome life... as a king!


> Bucket list: A list of activities someone wants to do before they die is often called a bucket list, because it is a list of things a person wants to do before they "kick the bucket."
